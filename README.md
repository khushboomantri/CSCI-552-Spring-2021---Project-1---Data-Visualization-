# CSCI-552-Spring-2021---Project-1---Data-Visualization-

CSCI 552(Spring 2021)Project #1Handout:  
Thursday, February 25, 2021
Due:  11:59 pm, Thursday, March 11, 2021
Total points:  50

In this project, you will use the datasets available at https://www.gapminder.org/data/to experiment with multi-dimensional visualization techniques using D3.

1.Extract  data  from  https://www.gapminder.org/data/  to  construct  ad-dimensional(dâ‰¥5) dataset. In this dataset, countries or regions are individual data points.  
Eachdata point will havednumber of attributes which come from https://www.gapminder.org/data/.You need to clean the dataset to ensure consistencies. For example, all attributes 
should come from roughly the same time period, and missing data should be avoided or filled.
The selection of attributes to download should be based on some interesting ideas orhypothesis that you are trying to demonstrate or confirm.


2.  Use D3 to visualize yourd-dimensional dataset with 3 different multi-dimensional datavisualization techniques that D3 provides. 
Ideally, these 3 different visualizations willprovide some interactive functions, and should reveal different aspects of the data.


3.  Write a description about what insight you gain from these visualizations: 
discovery,revelation, surprises, etc.Please submit your D3 source code and the visualization results as jpeg images.
